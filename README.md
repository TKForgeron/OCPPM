# How Object-Centric is Object-Centric Predictive Process Monitoring?
## Introducing Objects into Object-Centric Predictive Process Monitoring
Object-centric predictive process monitoring research project. The purpose of this project is to handle object-centric event data as naturally as possible for machine learning purposes. In our solution we propose to construct heterogeneous object event graphs per trace to learn how to best include object information into predictions for events (using heterogeneous graph neural network architectures).
