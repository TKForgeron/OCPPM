# OCPPM
Object-centric predictive process monitoring research project. The purpose of this project is to handle object-centric event data as naturally as possible for machine learning purposes. This means that graph structures are retained and even learned from.

## Updating ocpa
1. `pip uninstall ocpa`
2. `pip install git+https://github.com/TKForgeron/ocpa`
